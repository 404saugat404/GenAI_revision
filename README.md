This is the repo where im trying to revise how to use large language models such as openai, google gemeni etc for various kinds of works.ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€
You can just clone the repo and install requirements.txt and you are ready to go.
NOte that some of the functions are need to be modified since they will be deprecated, so try using your googling skills for those onesğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…
